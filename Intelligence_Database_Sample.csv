A fast learning model may be trained based on the modified classifiers, the data, and the data corresponding to the observed classification errors. And, another confidence value may be generated and associated with the classification of the data by the fast learning model. Report information may be generated based on a comparison result of the confidence value associated with the fast learning model and the confidence value associated with the deep learning model."

Advantage updating is a direct learning technique; it does not require a model to be given or learned. It is incremental, requiring only a constant amount of calculation per time step, independent of the number of possible actions, possible outcomes from a given action, or number of states. Analysis and simulation indicate that advantage updating is applicable to reinforcement learning systems working in continuous time (or discrete time with small time steps) for which Q-learning is not applicable. Simulation results are presented indicating that for a simple linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem with no noise and large time steps, advantage updating learns slightly faster than Q-learning. When there is noise or small time steps, advantage updating learns more quickly than Q-learning by a factor of more than 100,000. Convergence properties and implementation issues are discussed. New convergence results are presented for R-learning and algorithms based upon change in value. It is proved that the learning rule for advantage updating converges to the optimal policy with probability one."

Most practical approaches use a heuristic, typically gradient-descent, algorithm to search for a solution in the huge space of possible solutions. Such methods are by definition sensitive to starting points. It has been well-known that clustering algorithms are extremely sensitive to initial conditions. Most methods for guessing an initial solution simply make random guesses. In this paper we present a method that takes an initial condition and efficiently produces a refined starting condition. The method is applicable to a wide class of clustering algorithms for discrete and continuous data. In this paper we demonstrate how this method is applied to the popular K-means clustering algorithm and show that refined initial starting points indeed lead to improved solutions. The technique can be used as an initializer for other clustering solutions. The method is based on an efficient technique for estimating the modes of a distribution and runs in time guaranteed to be less than overall clustering time for large data sets. The method is also scalable and hence can be efficiently used on huge databases to refine starting points for scalable clustering algorithms in data mining applications."

The system includes a data reduction module (50) which reduces data into one or more clusters. This is accomplished by the use of one or more functions including a genetic clustering function, a hierarchical valley formation function, a symbolic exspansion reduction function, a fuzzy case clustering function, a relational clustering function, a K-means clustering function, a Kohonen neural network clustering function, and a minimum distance classifier clustering function. A data analysis modual (60) autonomously determines one or more correlations among the clusters. The corrolations represent knowlege."
